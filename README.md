- `/Website` - Marketing/landing website (Next.js)

## Getting Started

This project is still in active development. Check back later for installation and usage instructions.

### Running the App Locally (Development)

If you want to check out the desktop application in its current development stage:

**Prerequisites:**
- Node.js (v20 or higher recommended)
- npm or yarn
- Java (required for running Minecraft servers)

**Steps:**

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/404twillCODE/Hexnode.git
   cd Hexnode
   ```

2. **Navigate to the App directory:**
   ```bash
   cd App
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the application in development mode:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the React development server and launch the Electron app. The app will automatically reload when you make changes to the code.

**Note:** The application is in early development and many features may be incomplete or non-functional. Expect bugs and missing functionality.
