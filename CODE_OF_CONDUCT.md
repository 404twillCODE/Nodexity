## Code of Conduct

We want Hexnode’s community (GitHub + Discord) to be welcoming and respectful.

### Be respectful
- Assume good intent.
- Critique ideas, not people.
- No harassment, hate speech, or doxxing.

### Be constructive
- Provide actionable feedback.
- Keep discussions on-topic.
- Help newcomers where possible.

### Enforcement
If someone is behaving inappropriately, moderators/maintainers may remove content or restrict access.
